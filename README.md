# Snow

Unreal4 based game slice demonstrator.
Shows the following Unreal features:
- FPV controls
- video playthrough
- object addition and removal
- controlled pawn manipulation (forced move and rotation).

Game controls:

Q = quit the game
Space = skip cut scene
P = dig

Game play through:
There are three avalanche burials on the map. Right of the player spawn point, a red glove marks the direction of the first victim. The avalanche beacon shows general distance (but not direction) to the burial. First body is in the open.

Second body can be found along the lake shore and then to the right, it is under snow. Once dug within 1 meter, the body will be uncovered.
The third victim (Jenna) is the only one that can be saved. She is next to her snowboard and can be found using the beacon bearings.

Limitations: objects cannot be manipulated.
